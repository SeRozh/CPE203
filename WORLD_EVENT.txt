Chris Aruiza and Shad Hussain
Project 4 - World Event

1. The event can be triggered via clicking the mouse.
2. A volcano background will appear on the tile where the click is registered. 
   Additionally, magma blocks will form as the background in a 3 x 3 grid from the volcano
3. Within a 5 x 5 grid from the volcano (where the mouse click occurred), any OreBlob within this radius
   will convert to a LavaBlob, changing the behavior. The LavaBlobs will attack and destroy the blacksmith.
4. The new entity we created is the Peanut Butter Gif Soldier. This entity will spawn at the mouse click and 
   has the behavior of seeking and destroying any miners. 
5. Chris implemented the mouse click triggering the event and developed the change in behavior for the OreBlob to LavaBlob.
   Shad developed the entire Peanut Butter Gif Soldier class and implemented the code to have them spawn.
   Together we fixed any bugs and talked out the logistics of the code. We worked together through a repository
   and sharing screens on a zoom call.
